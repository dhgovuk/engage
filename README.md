# engage

A WordPress theme built to host the content formats that GOV.UK currently can’t:
- [Commentable documents](http://careandsupportregs.dh.gov.uk/)
- [Complex publications](http://www.engage.dh.gov.uk/francisresponse/recommendation/)
- [Policy landing pages](http://www.engage.dh.gov.uk/dementiachallenge/), with links to external content and the ability to sign up for email updates
- [Live events](https://digitalhealth.blog.gov.uk/2014/03/18/g8-dementia-evaluation/)
 
The platform is consistent with the GOV.UK approach as far as possible. The front end has been designed using the [GOV.UK front end toolkit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit) and we're committed to continual improvement of the platform to better serve the user need. It’s consistent (not uniform) in design, speaks in Plain English, is mobile responsive, and meets the AA standards for accessibility. In terms of the user experience for our internal user group, the platform has an efficient and flexible back-end.
